		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Background</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">Confirmit, Inc. is a Business Management Consultant company, whose industry leading software and services help businesses listen to customers, markets and employees, analyze insights and take action to drive business growth. During my time interning as a marketing assistant / graphic designer, I got to experience the culture of a big technology / business oriented firm as well as how to manage and nurture the relationship between the company and its potential customers (leads).</p>

		<br>

		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Branded Graphical Elements</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">Voice of Customer &ldquo;Eye&rdquo; is a customer engagement model that represents Confirmit's multi-channel data collection structure. It is among the the top three most essential services of the company, and this graphic gets slightly modified for so many times. To add the sense of being natural, smooth, and friendly, we drew several gradient layers underneath it.</p>

		<p class="proj-sm-col">I updated several long decks of Power Point presentations, modified marketing materials for conferences. It was not super complicated, yet a long, certainly mechanic but also thought-provoking process. I learned the importance between the market department, sales department, and the upper management level, as long as how to modify and maintain files that will be used by many people.</p>

		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Website Layout Mockups</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">By the end of my internship, I was asked to create mockups / potential new looks for the company's upcoming website for their German headquarter. Obviously, there were not a lot of flexibilities under the brand guideline and the look of the existing English version site, but it was still interesting to actually recreate the corporate style visual elements, which I had not done before.</p>
