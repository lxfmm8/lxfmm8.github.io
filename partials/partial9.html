		<div id="quotation">&ldquo;We have an understanding of two phenomena: 
			<br><strong style="font-size: 1.3em">1 )</strong> Technology is leading to a proliferation of data at faster rates than humans are able to the analyze and interpret; 
			<br><strong style="font-size: 1.3em">2 )</strong> Technology, by allowing people to tailor their interactions to pre-screened, predetermined attributes, is causing the world to become more compartmentalized and segregated than is believed. The software tackles problem 1 but it is meant to be a part of a larger platform that ultimately addresses problem 2.&rdquo;

			<p>In the process of creating mockups and digital resource gadgets for this complex enterprise software, I started by following along with a given standard style guide, including fonts, color palettes, and logic of the imagined user experience flow, and then I created a number of sets of user interfaces based on the goal of each page of logics (meetings, roadshows, contacts, feedback, alerts, etc.) and discussed with the team to come up with the better ones. At the same time, I had to consider specific styles for typography and layout strustures including how the UIs animate and handed them to the developer.</p>
