		<h1>The Extendables</h1>
		<strong>Toy Design | Web Design | Illustration</strong>
		<p>For today’s kids, high-tech devices are made rather accessible to them, which is causing kids to ignore the physical world and supposedly engaging objects, yet physical toys are not often built cross-platform in order to let children not only carry them around, but also be aware of the advancement of today’s technology. I wanted to re-picture a toy world that was partially physical, partially digital and that acts as a platform for media and itself in a poetic fashion. The toy may create its living environment on its own. Augmented Reality seems like a proper way of giving physical objects an identity and set of behaviors in new and existing media worlds.</p>
