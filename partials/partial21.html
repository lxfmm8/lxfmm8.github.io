		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Kirby 100</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">To simulate the unique style of the comic legend, Jack Kirby's art, we used a bright palette, blocky shapes, and thick strokes to celebrate the artist's 100th birthday and his legacy. I also created a custom logotype from one of the popular comic style fonts at the time. Our editorial and publishing teams curated 100 of Kirby's characters, 100 of Kirby's cover art, and an ongoing total of 100 articles for this hub, as exclusive content at Marvel.com.</p>

		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Holiday Gift Guide</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">Marvel worked with the toy company Hasbro for a brand new holiday gift guide website by the end of 2017. I helped created all the visual frameworks, graphic placements, and most of the icons and patterns. One highlight of this year's website was the list inlay design pattern of the recommended products, which was made to be inviting, but at the same time, saving a lot of screen space.</p>

		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Marvel Emails</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">Marvel Insider is the first Marvel loyalty program that offers tangible and digital rewards for members who engage with the brand online. People can earn through a variety of engagements with Marvel – from watching free videos to checking in at your local comic book store – and the rewards range from free digital comics to wallpapers to a subscription to the Marvel Unlimited app. In order to help promote different LOBs withinin the company with their own messages and branding, I follow and shape the guidelines and templates to give the brands fresh and efficient layouts.</p>

		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Madefire Motion Comics Reader</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">In 2017, I helped the product team with their visual refinement for the embedded reader custom comics on the Marvel and Lexus - Black Panther Soul of A Machine website. We worked with Madefire, a company who creates motion comic books, on an online reader that was specifically designed for Lexus and Black Panther. I rearranged and provided guides for typography, and created a new set of icons for the reader. This set of icons work not only with the Lexus and Black Panther website, but also align with the visual designs in other Marvel reader apps.</p>
