		<p>A significant difference between Eastern and Western painting lies in the format. Among the traditional Chinese handscroll paintings, for instance, since many of the scrolls can be very long, the viewer must unroll from left to right to examine only a shoulder-width section of the painting. In other words, the way museums today display many of the ancient Chinese scroll paintings is not the same way people actually looked at them in the past. A similar idea is applied here in my "browser illustrations". The graphics are made by section, and the viewer has to see them by section, too. I aim to create a series of imageries that are dynamic and interrelated using clean lines and shapes to establish structures and convey ideas. Letters are used as perspective transformers. By showing my chain of thought, I try to inspire, not to impress the audience.</p>
