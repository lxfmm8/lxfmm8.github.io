		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Background</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">Brookfield is a leading global alternative asset manager, focused on investing in long-life, high quality assets across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power and private equity. In order to give a new look to their old Flash &amp; XML based internal presentation system, Union Design has completed an all-around project on designing and developing a CMS-centralized multi-platform application. The project was officially released in 2016.</p>

<br>

		<!-- <h3 class="proj-sm-col">New CMS</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">For the old presentation system, touchscreen display and dual screen displays are created with Flash and XML, while the iPad app was made using a different XML method. It was very time-consuming to update content across all platforms. Since new contents, stats, images, etc. come from different headquarters/cities of the client, the application needs to be constantly updated by the design team. Occasionally, new functionalities of the CMS, modified versions of page structures are created. To suit the needs of both production of designers and presenters of the client company, user interfaces of both the CMS system and the actual application are gradually growing and transforming to be as efficient and humanistic as possible. With the new CMS, art of different resolutions for different layouts can be uploaded at the same time.</p>

		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Design</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">Based on the old presentation system, we first reorganized all business units, countries, markets, and other customized sections within the application structures in the form of a few flow charts and diagrams, then we worked on the look &amp; feel of the new presentation branding, which is the color (for common text and image based pages) and grayscale (for map based pages) gradient <span style="white-space: nowrap;">background series.</span></p>

		<h3 class="proj-sm-col">Iconography</h3>
		<p class="proj-sm-col">I took a very literal approach making icons for specifications and information for the properties. It is a challenge to make minimal visual elements expressive, simple, and systematic at the same time.</p>
