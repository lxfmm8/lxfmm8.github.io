		<p>These paper prototypes are meant to use as little technology as possible to help children to develop their motor skills and cognitive knowledge. The project started with a simple idea: "Can a toy grow along with the child?" Video games, Apps, and other screen-based content are mentally loud and visually overwhelming, which is causing kids to ignore the physical world and supposedly engaging objects, yet physical toys are not often built cross-platform in order to let children not only carry them around, but also be aware of the advancement of todayâ€™s technology. I wanted to re-picture a toy world that was partially physical, partially digital and that acts as a platform for media and itself in a poetic fashion. The toy may create its living environment on its own. AR seems like a proper way of giving physical objects an identity and set of behaviors in new and existing media worlds.</p>
