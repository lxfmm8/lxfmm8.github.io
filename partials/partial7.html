		<p>Toy Design | Paper Engineering</p>

		<p>These paper prototypes are meant to use as little technology as possible to help children to develop their motor skills and cognitive knowledge. The project started with a simple idea: "Can a toy grow along with the child?" Video games, Apps, and other screen-based content are mentally loud and visually overwhelming, which is causing kids to ignore the physical world and supposedly engaging objects, yet physical toys are not often built cross-platform in order to let children not only carry them around, but also be aware of the advancement of todayâ€™s technology.</p>
